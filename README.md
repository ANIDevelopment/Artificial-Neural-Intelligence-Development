# Artificial-Neural-Intelligence-Development

This organization (and repositories) are only for you who want to develop new ways to artificially simulate/create concious mind
in different computeter environments. This repository should only contain code for the basic functioning of the neural network
itself, tho other repositories can (and will) be created for further experiments or quick-testing id√©as one might get along
the neverending development time. (yes: optimizing can and won't ever stop, at least not during my (living) time here on earth).
